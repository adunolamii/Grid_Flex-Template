            <h2>I received a job offer mind course and the subject I learnt were current, if not more so in the company i joined. I honestly feel I got the penny I worth.</h2>
            <p>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I have looking to make a transition and I have heard people who heard amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun. I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12weeks was the best time of my life. Since completing the course I've switched career, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>

            <h2>Such a life changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
            <p>"Before joining the bootcamp. I have never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encourage to enroll by a former student of theirs who can say woderful things about the programe. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project in particular was outstanding. It look learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could have in. In fact,I have ofter reffered to it during interview as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recomend". </p>
