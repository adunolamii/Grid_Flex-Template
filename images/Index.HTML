            <h2>I received a job offer mind course and the subject I learnt were current, if not more so in the company i joined. I honestly feel I got the penny I worth.</h2>
            <p>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I have looking to make a transition and I have heard people who heard amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun. I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12weeks was the best time of my life. Since completing the course I've switched career, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</p>
